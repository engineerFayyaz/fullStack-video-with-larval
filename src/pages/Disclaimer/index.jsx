            Community Guidelines At Our Brand TV our mission is to provide the
            best creator videos created by our growing community where creators
            and communities can showcase talent nationally and affordably. To
            achieve this goal, we ask that all producers participate in such a
            way that promotes a friendly, positive experience for our global
            community. In addition to our Terms of Service, we provide the
            following guidelines for our community. These guidelines fall under
            a common sense philosophy and apply to all user generated content
            and activity on our services. This is considered a living document
            that we regularly update based on the evolution of the Outbrandtv
            community and service. Additional guidelines or specific exceptions
            may be applicable for certain services or properties under
            OurBrandTV
            <br />
            <br />
            To protect the integrity of our community, as the provider of the
            service, we at OurBrandTV reserve the right to suspend any account
            at any time for any conduct that we determine to be inappropriate or
            harmful. Such actions may include: removal of content, a strike on
            the account, and/or suspension of account(s). Please refer to this
            page for more detail: About Suspensions.
            <br />
            Breaking the Law
            <br />
            <br />
            You must respect all applicable local, national, and international
            laws while using our services. Any content or activity featuring,
            encouraging, offering, or soliciting illegal activity is prohibited.
            This includes committing or aiding in the malicious destruction,
            defacement, or theft of public or another person’s private property
            without permission on stream.
            <br />
            Suspension Evasion
            <br />
            All suspensions are binding until expiration or removal upon
            successful appeal. Any attempt to circumvent an account suspension
            or chat ban by using other accounts, identities, or by appearing on
            another user’s account will also result in an additional enforcement
            against your accounts, up to an indefinite suspension. In addition,
            it is prohibited to use your channel to knowingly feature or
            advertise a suspended user. We understand that there may be
            instances where suspended users may appear on your stream due to
            circumstances beyond your control, such as through third-party
            gaming tournaments, but we expect that you make a good faith effort
            to remove them from your broadcast, mute them, or otherwise limit
            their interactions with your stream.
            <br />
            Self-Destructive Behavior
            <br />
            Activity that may endanger your life, lead to your physical harm, or
            encourage others to engage in physically harmful behavior is
            prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to: suicide threats,
            glorification or encouragement of self-harm, intentional physical
            trauma, illegal use of drugs, illegal or dangerous consumption of
            alcohol, and dangerous or distracted driving.
            <br />
            Violence and Threats
            <br />
            Acts and threats of violence will be taken seriously and are
            considered zero-tolerance violations and all accounts associated
            with such activities will be indefinitely suspended. This includes,
            but is not limited to:
            <br />
            .Attempts or threats to physically harm or kill others
            <br />
            .Attempts or threats to hack, DDOS, or SWAT others
            <br />
            .Use of weapons to physically threaten, intimidate, harm, or kill
            others
            <br />
            <br />

            Use of weapons to physically threaten, intimidate, harm, or kill
            others Twitch does not allow content that depicts, glorifies,
            encourages, or supports terrorism, or violent extremist actors or
            acts. This includes threatening to or encouraging others to commit
            acts that would result in serious physical harm to groups of people
            or significant property destruction. You may not display or link
            terrorist or extremist propaganda, including graphic pictures or
            footage of terrorist or extremist violence, even for the purposes of
            denouncing such content. In situations where a user has lost control
            of their broadcast due to severe injury, medical emergency, police
            action, or being targeted with serious violence, we will temporarily
            remove the channel and associated content. In exceptional
            circumstances, we may preemptively suspend accounts when we believe
            an individual’s use of Twitch poses a high likelihood of inciting
            violence. In weighing the risk of harm, we consider an individual’s
            influence, the level of recklessness in their past behaviors
            (regardless of whether any past behavior occurred on Twitch),
            <br />
            <br />

            whether or not there continues to be a risk of harm, and the scale
            of ongoing threats. Hateful Conduct and Harassment Hateful conduct
            and harassment are not allowed on Twitch. Hateful conduct is any
            content or activity that promotes or encourages discrimination,
            denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following
            protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, color, caste, national
            origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity,
            sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and
            veteran status.
            <br />
            <br />

            We also provide certain protections for age. Twitch has zero
            tolerance for hateful conduct, meaning we act on every valid
            reported instance of hateful conduct. We afford every user equal
            protections under this policy, regardless of their particular
            characteristics. Harassment has many manifestations, including
            stalking, personal attacks, promotion of physical harm, hostile
            raids, and malicious false report brigading. Sexual harassment,
            specifically, can take the form of unwelcome sexual advances and
            solicitations, sexual objectification, or degrading attacks relating
            to a person’s perceived sexual practices.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will take action on all instances of hateful conduct and
            harassment, with an increasing severity of enforcement when the
            behavior is targeted, personal, graphic, or repeated/prolonged,
            incites further abuse, or involves threats of violence or coercion.
            The most egregious violations may result in an indefinite suspension
            on the first offense. Learn more about our hateful conduct and
            harassment policies and enforcement. Unauthorized Sharing of Private
            Information Do not invade the privacy of others. It is prohibited to
            share content that may reveal private personal information about
            individuals, or their private property, without permission. This
            includes but is not limited to: Sharing personally identifiable
            information
            <br />

            (such as real name, location, or ID) Sharing restricted or protected
            social profiles or any information from those profiles Sharing
            content that violates another’s reasonable expectation of privacy,
            for example streaming from a private space, without permission
            Impersonation Content or activity meant to impersonate an individual
            or organization is prohibited. Any attempts to misrepresent yourself
            as a member of Twitch representatives is a zero-tolerance violation
            and will result in indefinite suspension. Spam, Scams, and Other
            Malicious Conduct Any content or activity that disrupts, interrupts,
            harms, or otherwise violates the integrity of Twitch services or
            another user’s experience or devices is prohibited.
            <br />

            unwanted messages or user reports Distributing unauthorized
            advertisements Phishing Defrauding others Spreading malware or
            viruses Misinformation (such as feigning distress, posting
            misleading metadata, or intentional channel miscategorization)
            Tampering (such as artificially inflating follow or live viewer
            stats) Selling or sharing user accounts Reselling Twitch services or
            features (such as channel Moderator status) Defacing, or attempting
            to deface, website pages or other Twitch services (such as uploading

            and Other Sexual Content Nudity and sexually explicit content or

            and may be reported to law enforcement. Child exploitation will be
            reported to authorities via the National Center for Missing &
            Exploited Children. Sexually suggestive content or activities are
            also prohibited, although they may be allowed in educational
            contexts or for pre-approved licensed content, in each case subject
            to additional restrictions. Learn more about our sexual content
            policies and enforcement. Extreme Violence, Gore, and Other Obscene

            Twitch channel that you do not own or otherwise do not have the
            rights to share on Twitch, you may be infringing another person’s
            intellectual property rights. This includes any third party content
            included in your content, derivative creations, or performances of
            others’ copyrighted content. We encourage you to assess your content
            for adherence to applicable intellectual property laws and the
            proper application of principles such as fair use, and to secure all
            appropriate rights needed, before sharing your content on Twitch.
            Any unauthorized content you share on OB TV violates our Terms of
